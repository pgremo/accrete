Simulates the creation of planetary systems using the Dole
accretion model.

This program simulates the creation of a planetary system by
accretion of planetismals.  Individual planets sweep out dust and
gas until all of the dust is swept up.  Planets whose orbits are
close are coalesced.

See [Accrete](http://www-leland.stanford.edu/~iburrell/create/accrete.html)
for more history of this model and programs.
